# Task App

## Overview
This is a **Dockerized full-stack application** using:
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) Next.js (TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express)
- **Database**: MySQL 8
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## üìÇ Project Structure

This is a simple Task Management App built using the following tech stack:

### Features
- Mobile-responsive UI
- Add, edit, and mark tasks as done
- Only the most recent 5 to-do tasks are displayed in the UI
- Completed tasks are removed from the UI

## Architecture
The system consists of three main components:

1. **Database:** Stores to-do tasks in a table named `task`.
2. **Backend API:** REST API built using Node.js and Express.js to facilitate user operations.
3. **Frontend UI:** A simple SPA built using Next.js and TypeScript.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
